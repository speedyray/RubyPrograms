In the first case, you get a string containing the entire contents of the file. In the sec- ond case, you get an array of lines.
These two class methods exist purely for convenience. They take care of opening and closing the file handle for you; you don’t have to do any system-level housekeep- ing. Most of the time, you’ll want to do something more complex and/or more effi- cient than reading the entire contents of a file into a string or an array at one time. Given that even the read and readlines instance methods are relatively coarse- grained tools, if you decide to read a file in all at once, you may as well go all the way and use the class-method versions.
You now have a good toolkit for reading files and dealing with the results. At this point, we’ll turn to the other side of the equation: writing to files.
